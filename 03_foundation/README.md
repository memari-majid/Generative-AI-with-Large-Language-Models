Chapter 3: Large-Language Foundation Models
In this chapter, you learned about the training process of large-language foundation models, focusing on the pretraining phase. Pretraining a multibillion-parameter model from scratch is a compute-intensive task, requiring millions of GPU hours and trillions of tokens. While it is uncommon to train a foundation model from scratch, understanding the effort and resources required helps in appreciating the complexity of these models.

Pretrained Models and Model Hubs
At the start of any generative AI project, it is advisable to use publicly available pretrained models rather than training from scratch. Model hubs such as Hugging Face Model HubLinks to an external site., PyTorch Hub, and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart offer access to various pretrained models along with their model cards. Model cards contain key information such as training details, context window size, and known limitations, enabling developers to choose the right model for their use case.

Tokenizers and Embedding Vectors
Generative AI models use tokenizers to convert human-readable text into tokenized representations (input_ids) that the model can process. These tokens are mapped to embedding vectors, high-dimensional numerical representations that capture the meaning and context of tokens. Embedding vectors are critical for representing language in a way that models can understand, and they are learned during the pretraining phase.

Transformer Architecture
The Transformer architecture is the backbone of most modern generative AI models. Transformers rely on self-attention mechanisms to learn the contextual relationships between tokens. The architecture includes components such as the encoder, self-attention layers, and the softmax output layer, which helps the model generate the next token based on probability distributions. Transformers can vary in architecture, with three common types:

Encoder-only models: These models use bidirectional representations and are suited for tasks like text classification (e.g., BERT).
Decoder-only models: These models use autoregressive techniques to generate text (e.g., GPT, LLaMA models).
Encoder-decoder models: These sequence-to-sequence models are used for tasks like translation and summarization (e.g., T5, FLAN-T5).
Scaling Laws and Compute-Optimal Models
Empirical scaling laws describe the relationship between model size, dataset size, and compute budget. These laws, as discussed in the Chinchilla paperLinks to an external site., suggest that by increasing the dataset size relative to the model parameters, models can achieve state-of-the-art performance without needing extremely large parameter sizes. For example, the LLaMA-2 model outperformed larger models like GPT-3 due to its optimized dataset-to-parameter ratio.

Pretraining Datasets
Popular datasets used for pretraining foundation models include WikipediaLinks to an external site., Common CrawlLinks to an external site., The PileLinks to an external site., and C4. These datasets provide large-scale text data for training language models. Some models also incorporate proprietary data to fine-tune the pretraining process for specific domains, as seen with BloombergGPT.

In conclusion, this chapter provided a deeper understanding of how foundation models are trained, the importance of scaling laws, and the role of pretrained models in generative AI projects. These concepts serve as a foundation for building and optimizing AI systems using large-language models.
