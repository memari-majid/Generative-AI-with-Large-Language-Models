## 1. `README.md`
The `README.md` provides an introduction to different model types like LLaMA 2, Falcon, and GPT2 and explains how to utilize these models through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. It introduces essential concepts like `text-generation` and the parameters you can pass for model inference.

### Key Points from the `README.md`:
- Describes parameters like `max_length`, `num_beams`, `temperature`, etc., which control the behavior of text generation.
- Explains how to invoke SageMaker endpoints and provides information on how the model generates responses using beam search and other sampling techniques.

## 2. `01_llama2_chatbot_sagemaker_jumpstart.py`
This script demonstrates deploying the LLaMA 2 model for a chatbot application using SageMaker. It includes setting up a SageMaker model endpoint, invoking it, and generating text responses.

### Key Concepts:
- **SageMaker Endpoint Deployment**: The script shows how to deploy a chatbot with LLaMA 2 using AWS SageMaker, which serves as the model backend for inference.
- **Text Generation**: Code snippets include sending a sample input prompt to the model and processing the generated text.

## 3. `02_llama2_assistant_sagemaker_jumpstart.py`
Similar to the first script, this one focuses on creating a more advanced assistant-like chatbot using LLaMA 2 on SageMaker. The assistant can handle complex queries and generate more informative responses.

### Key Concepts:
- **Enhanced Inference**: It goes beyond simple chatbot capabilities by implementing features like beam search, increasing `max_length`, and improving response generation.

## 4. `03_falcon_chatbot_sagemaker_jumpstart.py`
This file illustrates deploying the Falcon model for chatbot purposes using SageMaker. The Falcon model is another generative AI model, designed to generate human-like text.

### Key Concepts:
- **Falcon Model**: Focuses on deploying Falcon as a chatbot and interacting with it via SageMaker.
- **Inference Parameters**: Similar to LLaMA 2 but adjusted for the Falcon model to fine-tune response generation.

## 5. `04_falcon_chain_of_thought_sagemaker_jumpstart.py`
This file extends the Falcon model with Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting techniques, where the model generates a more logical and step-by-step response.

### Key Concepts:
- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: This helps in generating more structured, reasoning-based answers.
- **Model Interaction**: It builds on top of the Falcon chatbot by adding structured logic in the model's text generation.

## 6. `05_gpt2_codeparrot_pretrain_from_scratch.py`
This script showcases the pre-training of GPT-2 using the CodeParrot dataset from scratch. The CodeParrot dataset contains code snippets, and the training focuses on creating a model specialized in code generation.

### Key Concepts:
- **Pre-training from Scratch**: Training the model on a large dataset using HuggingFaceâ€™s `Trainer` and handling the dataset using tokenizers.
- **Code Generation**: The model is fine-tuned to generate Python code snippets.

Each file contains its own set of hyperparameters for controlling generation behavior, which includes parameters like `max_new_tokens`, `temperature`, and `beam search`. The scripts make extensive use of AWS services for deployment and training, with special handling for model inference via SageMaker.
