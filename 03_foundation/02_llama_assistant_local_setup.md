# Running the Llama Assistant Locally

This guide will help you set up and run the Llama Assistant script locally on your machine without using AWS services.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Local Model**: You need to have a local version of a suitable model. This could be a smaller version of the Llama model or any other model that can run on your local machine.

3. **Dependencies**: Install necessary Python packages.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Required Python Packages

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### Step 2: Modify the Script

You need to modify the script to load a local model instead of using SageMaker. Here is an example of how you can modify the script:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "distilgpt2"  # Replace with your local model name
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

def local_model_inference(prompt, temperature=0.6):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=512, top_p=0.9, temperature=temperature)
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Replace the generate function in your script with local_model_inference
def generate(prompt, temperature=0.6):
    return local_model_inference(prompt, temperature)

# Rest of your code remains the same
```

### Step 3: Run the Script

1. **Download the Script**: Save the modified `02_llama_assistant_sagemaker_jumpstart.py` script to your local machine.

2. **Execute the Script**: Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python 02_llama_assistant_sagemaker_jumpstart.py
   ```

### Step 4: Interact with the Chatbot

Once the script is running, you can interact with the chatbot by modifying the script to include your queries or by extending it to accept user input dynamically.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model Loading Issues**: Ensure the model and tokenizer are correctly downloaded and accessible on your local machine.

- **Python Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and that you are using a compatible Python version.
