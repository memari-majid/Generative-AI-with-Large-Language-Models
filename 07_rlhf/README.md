Chapter 7: Fine-Tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
In this chapter, you will learn how to fine-tune models using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While instruction fine-tuning improves model performance, it doesn’t always prevent undesirable or harmful outputs. Reinforcement learning helps align model responses with human values like helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness (HHH), creating more human-aligned models. Let’s explore how RLHF works and how to apply it effectively.

Human Alignment: Helpful, Honest, and Harmless
The goal of RLHF is to align model outputs with human preferences. A well-aligned model should provide helpful, honest, and harmless responses:

Helpful: The model should generate useful and relevant information for the prompt.
Honest: The model should generate factually correct responses and avoid spreading misinformation.
Harmless: The model should not generate harmful, offensive, or toxic content.
Reinforcement Learning Overview
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an iterative process where an agent learns by taking actions in an environment to maximize rewards. The goal is to learn a policy (a strategy) that selects the best actions to maximize rewards over time. In the context of generative models, the environment consists of the model’s context, the action space includes possible tokens, and the reward is based on human preferences.

Reward Models
A reward model predicts whether the model output aligns with human preferences. These models are often trained using human feedback collected from human annotators who rank model completions based on helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. You can use existing reward models or train your own.

Collecting Human Feedback
Using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth, you can collect rankings from human labelers. Labelers compare multiple completions for a given prompt and rank them. These rankings are then converted into pairwise comparisons for training a reward model.

Training a Custom Reward Model
A reward model is typically a binary classifier that predicts whether a response is preferred or not. The model is trained using pairs of completions where one is labeled as preferred and the other as non-preferred. The goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted reward and the human-labeled reward.

Pretrained Reward Models
In addition to training your own reward models, you can use pretrained models, like Meta’s toxicity detector, to reduce the likelihood of generating toxic or harmful content. These models assign rewards based on how toxic or non-toxic the text is, allowing the model to learn to generate less toxic responses.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
RLHF involves fine-tuning a model’s weights to better align with human preferences using reward feedback. The RL algorithm commonly used in RLHF is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which updates the model weights iteratively based on the reward value assigned by the reward model.

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
PPO makes small updates to the model weights in each iteration, optimizing the policy to maximize the reward while avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize the model. The PPO algorithm helps the model learn to generate preferred, human-aligned responses over time.

Mitigating Reward Hacking
One potential issue in RLHF is "reward hacking," where the model generates responses that maximize the reward but are nonsensical or incorrect. To prevent this, you can use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to compare the fine-tuned model’s outputs with those of an immutable reference model. If the outputs diverge too far from the reference model, the reward is penalized.

Using PEFT in RLHF
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, can be combined with RLHF to reduce the resource requirements of fine-tuning. By updating a smaller set of parameters, PEFT techniques allow for more efficient training during the PPO process while still aligning the model to human values.

Evaluating the Fine-Tuned Model
After fine-tuning, you should evaluate your model to ensure that it generates more human-aligned outputs. You can perform both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. For example, qualitative evaluation involves comparing individual model completions before and after fine-tuning, while quantitative evaluation uses metrics like toxicity scores to compare the overall performance across a test dataset.

Quantitative Evaluation Example
By calculating the aggregate toxicity score before and after RLHF fine-tuning, you can measure how well the model reduces toxic content. A reduction in the aggregate toxicity score indicates successful fine-tuning.

Summary
Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a powerful technique to align generative models with human preferences. By training reward models and fine-tuning using the PPO algorithm, you can improve the helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness of the model’s outputs. While RLHF can be resource-intensive, using methods like PEFT can optimize the process and reduce costs. After fine-tuning, it's essential to evaluate the model’s performance to ensure it meets human values.

In the next chapter, we will explore how to optimize and deploy these fine-tuned models for low-latency, high-performance inference.
