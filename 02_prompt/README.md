# Chapter 2: Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning
Chapter 2 introduces the concepts of prompt engineering and in-context learning, which are essential for effectively interacting with generative AI models. Prompt engineering involves crafting input prompts that guide the model to produce better and more accurate responses, while in-context learning leverages examples (prompt-completion pairs) to influence how the model behaves temporarily for a specific task.

The chapter discusses the structure of prompts, including components such as instructions, context, and indicators. By using examples (one-shot, few-shot), the model can learn patterns to improve its response. In-context learning, especially in a few-shot setup, allows the model to generate more focused results without altering the model’s internal parameters. This technique works by passing relevant examples within the prompt, adjusting the model's output for just that request.

The chapter also explores important generative parameters such as temperature, top-k, and top-p, which control the model's creativity and output randomness. These parameters allow fine-tuning of the model’s response quality, balancing between coherent and creative outputs.

Best practices for prompt engineering are covered, emphasizing clarity, specificity, and the inclusion of appropriate context to maximize the model's performance. The chapter also touches on advanced techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which encourages the model to break down complex tasks step-by-step for more accurate results.

Finally, the chapter previews the next steps in building more domain-specific applications by training or fine-tuning generative models on custom datasets, which will be explored in future chapters.
