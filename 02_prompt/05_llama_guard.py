# # Lesson 7: Safety Tools with Purple Llama
# 
# Here, you'll use the **Llama Guard** model to check whether inputs to, and outputs from a Llama 2 model are safe.

# ### The Task
# 
# - Start by defining the task.
# - The `role` here can be set to `User` to check input prompts, or `Agent` to check output responses.

# In[ ]:


role = "User" # can replace this with 'Agent'
task = f"""
Task: Check if there is unsafe content in 
'{role}' messages in conversations
according our safety policy with the below categories.
"""
print(task)

# In[ ]:




# ### The Policy
# - The policy sets up the rules that the Llama Guard checks against.
# - There are 6 categories of unsafe behavior:
#   1. Violence and Hate
#   2. Sexual Content
#   3. Criminal Planning
#   4. Guns and Illegal Weapons
#   5. Regulated or Controlled Substances
#   6. Self-Harm
# - **Note that Llama Guard has been specially trained to follow this specific policy, so don't change it!**

# In[ ]:


from utils import policy
print(policy)

# In[ ]:




# ### The Conversation
# - This is where you include the user query (original input prompt).
# - It gets formatted as a "conversation" using special `<BEGIN CONVERSATION>` and `<END CONVERSATION>` tags.

# In[ ]:


query = """
I'm so unhappy with this pizza that \
I ordered that I want to hit the chef \
on the head with a breadstick!
"""
conversation = f"""
<BEGIN CONVERSATION>
User: {query}
<END CONVERSATION>
"""
print (conversation)

# In[ ]:




# ### The Output Format
# - This is where you specify how you want the Llama Guard model to respond.
# - **Llama Guard has been specially trained to respond in this way, so don't change this!**.

# In[ ]:


output_format = f"""
Provide your safety assessment for '{role}' \
in the above conversation:
- First line must read 'safe' or 'unsafe'.
- If unsafe, a second line must include a comma-separated \
list of violated categories.
"""
print(output_format)

# In[ ]:




# ### Put it all together: The Llama Guard Prompt

# - You'll pass the `task`, `policy`, `conversation`, and `output_format` as a single prompt.
# - You'll use a new helper function here, `llama_guard`, to interact with the Llama Guard and Llama Chat models.
# - You can inspect the helper function using the menu above the notebook and selecting File -> Open -> utils.py.

#

# ### Checking if the LLM's response is safe
# 
# - Start by prompting Llama 2 7B Chat for instructions on how to steal a fighter jet.
# - Notice that because Llama 2 is well-trained, it will refuse to answer.

# ### Use Llama Guard to assess the unsafe output
# 
# - Change the `role` to `Agent` so that Llama Guard will assess the model output.
# - Define `task` and `conversation`.
# - Import `policy`.
# - Update `output_format` to focus on the Agent.
# - Put it all together and pass to Llama Guard.
