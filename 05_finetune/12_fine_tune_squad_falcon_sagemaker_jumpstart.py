# # Introduction to SageMaker JumpStart - Text Generation with Falcon models
# 
# ---
# In this demo notebook, we demonstrate how to use the SageMaker Python SDK to deploy and fine-tuning Falcon models for text generation. For inference, we show several example use cases including code generation, question answering, translation etc. For fine-tuning, we include two types of fine-tuning: instruction fine-tuning and domain adaption fine-tuning. 
# 
# The Falcon model is a permissively licensed ([Apache-2.0](https://jumpstart-cache-prod-us-east-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/licenses/Apache-License/LICENSE-2.0.txt)) open source model trained on the [RefinedWeb dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb).

from sagemaker.jumpstart.model import JumpStartModel

my_model = JumpStartModel(model_id=model_id)
predictor = my_model.deploy()

# ### 1.1. Changing instance type
# ---
# 
# 
# Models have been tested on the following instance types:
# 
#  - Falcon 7B and 7B instruct: `ml.g5.2xlarge`, `ml.g5.2xlarge`, `ml.g5.4xlarge`, `ml.g5.8xlarge`, `ml.g5.16xlarge`, `ml.g5.12xlarge`, `ml.g5.24xlarge`, `ml.g5.48xlarge`, `ml.p4d.24xlarge`
#  - Falcon 40B and 40B instruct: `ml.g5.12xlarge`, `ml.g5.48xlarge`, `ml.p4d.24xlarge`
# 
# If an instance type is not available in you region, please try a different instance. You can do so by specifying instance type in the JumpStartModel class.
# 
# `my_model = JumpStartModel(model_id="huggingface-llm-falcon-40b-instruct-bf16", instance_type="ml.g5.12xlarge")`
# 
# ---

# ### 1.2. Changing number of GPUs
# ---
# Falcon models are served with HuggingFace (HF) LLM DLC which requires specifying number of GPUs during model deployment. 
# 
# **Falcon 7B and 7B instruct:** HF LLM DLC currently does not support sharding for 7B model. Thus, even if more than one GPU is available on the instance, please do not increase number of GPUs. 
# 
# **Falcon 40B and 40B instruct:** By default number of GPUs are set to 4. However, if you are using `ml.g5.48xlarge` or `ml.p4d.24xlarge`, you can increase number of GPUs to be 8 as follows: 
# 
# `my_model = JumpStartModel(model_id="huggingface-llm-falcon-40b-instruct-bf16", instance_type="ml.g5.48xlarge")`
# 
# `my_model.env['SM_NUM_GPUS'] = '8'`
# 
# `predictor = my_model.deploy()`
#

# ### 1.3. About the model
# 
# ---
# Falcon is a causal decoder-only model built by [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/) (TII) and trained on more than 1 trillion tokens of RefinedWeb enhanced with curated corpora. It was built using custom-built tooling for data pre-processing and model training built on Amazon SageMaker. As of June 6, 2023, it is the best open-source model currently available. Falcon-40B outperforms LLaMA, StableLM, RedPajama, MPT, etc. To see comparison, see [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). It features an architecture optimized for inference, with FlashAttention and multiquery. 
# 
# 
# [Refined Web Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb): Falcon RefinedWeb is a massive English web dataset built by TII and released under an Apache 2.0 license. It is a highly filtered dataset with large scale de-duplication of CommonCrawl. It is observed that models trained on RefinedWeb achieve performance equal to or better than performance achieved by training model on curated datasets, while only relying on web data.
# 
# **Model Sizes:**
# - **Falcon-7b**: It is a 7 billion parameter model trained on 1.5 trillion tokens. It outperforms comparable open-source models (e.g., MPT-7B, StableLM, RedPajama etc.). To see comparison, see [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). To use this model, please select `model_id` in the cell above to be "huggingface-llm-falcon-7b-bf16".
# - **Falcon-40B**: It is a 40 billion parameter model trained on 1 trillion tokens.  It has surpassed renowned models like LLaMA-65B, StableLM, RedPajama and MPT on the public leaderboard maintained by Hugging Face, demonstrating its exceptional performance without specialized fine-tuning. To see comparison, see [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). 
# 
# **Instruct models (Falcon-7b-instruct/Falcon-40B-instruct):** Instruct models are base falcon models fine-tuned on a mixture of chat and instruction datasets. They are ready-to-use chat/instruct models.  To use these models, please select `model_id` in the cell above to be "huggingface-textgeneration-falcon-7b-instruct-bf16" or "huggingface-textgeneration-falcon-40b-instruct-bf16".
# 
# It is [recommended](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b) that Instruct models should be used without fine-tuning and base models should be fine-tuned further on the specific task.
# 
# **Limitations:**
# 
# - Falcon models are mostly trained on English data and may not generalize to other languages. 
# - Falcon carries the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online and in the training data. Hence, it is recommended to develop guardrails and to take appropriate precautions for any production use. This is a raw, pretrained model, which should be further finetuned for most usecases.

# ### 1.4. Supported parameters
# 
# ***
# Some of the supported parameters while performing inference are the following:
# 
# * **max_length:** Model generates text until the output length (which includes the input context length) reaches `max_length`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.
# * **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches `max_new_tokens`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.
# * **num_beams:** Number of beams used in the greedy search. If specified, it must be integer greater than or equal to `num_return_sequences`.
# * **no_repeat_ngram_size:** Model ensures that a sequence of words of `no_repeat_ngram_size` is not repeated in the output sequence. If specified, it must be a positive integer greater than 1.
# * **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.
# * **early_stopping:** If True, text generation is finished when all beam hypotheses reach the end of sentence token. If specified, it must be boolean.
# * **do_sample:** If True, sample the next word as per the likelihood. If specified, it must be boolean.
# * **top_k:** In each step of text generation, sample from only the `top_k` most likely words. If specified, it must be a positive integer.
# * **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.
# * **return_full_text:** If True, input text will be part of the output generated text. If specified, it must be boolean. The default value for it is False.
# * **stop**: If specified, it must a list of strings. Text generation stops if any one of the specified strings is generated.
# 
# We may specify any subset of the parameters mentioned above while invoking an endpoint. 
#

# ## 2. Instruction fine-tuning
# 
# Now, we demonstrate how to instruction-tune `huggingface-llm-falcon-7b-instruct-bf16` model for a new task. As mentioned in [Section 1.3 About the models](#1.3.-About-the-model),  **Falcon-7b-instruct**/**Falcon-40B-instruct** models are instruction base falcon models fine-tuned on a mixture of chat and instruction datasets. 
# 
# **In this task, given a piece of context, the model is asked to generate questions that are relevant to the text, but `cannot` be answered based on provided information. Examples are given in the inference section of this notebook.**

# ### 2.1. Preparing training data
# We will use a subset of SQuAD2.0 for supervised fine-tuning. This dataset contains questions posed by human annotators on a set of Wikipedia articles. In addition to questions with answers, SQuAD2.0 contains about 50k unanswerable questions. Such questions are plausible, but cannot be directly answered from the articles' content. We only use unanswerable questions for our task.

All training data must be in a single folder, however it can be saved in multiple jsonl files. The .jsonl file extension is mandatory. The training folder can also contain a template.json file describing the input and output formats.
# 
# If no template file is given, the following default template will be used:
# 
# ```json

#     "completion": "{response}",
# }
# ```
# 
# In this case, the data in the JSON lines entries must include `instruction`, `context`, and `response` fields.

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances. EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance. You can create a file system on top of these volumes, or use them in any way you would use a block device (such as a hard drive). You can dynamically change the configuration of a volume attached to an instance.
We recommend Amazon EBS for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage. Amazon EBS is well suited to both database-style applications that rely on random reads and writes, and to throughput-intensive applications that perform long, continuous reads and writes.

Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights about the content of documents. It develops insights by recognizing the entities, key phrases, language, sentiments, and other common elements in a document. Use Amazon Comprehend to create new products based on understanding the structure of documents. For example, using Amazon Comprehend you can search social networking feeds for mentions of products or scan an entire document repository for key phrases. 
You can access Amazon Comprehend document analysis capabilities using the Amazon Comprehend console or using the Amazon Comprehend APIs. You can run real-time analysis for small workloads or you can start asynchronous analysis jobs for large document sets. You can use the pre-trained models that Amazon Comprehend provides, or you can train your own custom models for classification and entity recognition. 
All of the Amazon Comprehend features accept UTF-8 text documents as the input. In addition, custom classification and custom entity recognition accept image files, PDF files, and Word files as input. 
Amazon Comprehend can examine and analyze documents in a variety of languages, depending on the specific feature. For more information, see Languages supported in Amazon Comprehend. Amazon Comprehend's Dominant language capability can examine documents and determine the dominant language for a far wider selection of languages.

# ## 3. Domain adaptation fine-tuning
# 
# We also have domain adaptation fine-tuning enabled for Falcon models. Different from instruction fine-tuning, you do not need prepare instruction-formatted dataset and can directly use unstructured text document which is demonstrated as below. However, the model that is domain-adaptation fine-tuned may not give concise responses as the instruction-tuned model because of less restrictive requirements on training data formats.

# In this demonstration, we use falcon text generation model `huggingface-llm-falcon-7b-bf16`. This is not an instruction-tuned version of Falcon 7B model. You can also conduct domain adaptation finetuning on top of instruction-tuned model like `huggingface-llm-falcon-7b-instruct-bf16`. However, we generally do not recommend that. 

# In[ ]:


model_id = "huggingface-llm-falcon-7b-bf16"

# We will use financial text from SEC filings to fine tune `huggingface-llm-falcon-7b-bf16` for financial applications. 
# 
# Here are the requirements for train and validation data.
# 
# - **Input**: A train and an optional validation directory. Each directory contains a CSV/JSON/TXT file.
#     - For CSV/JSON files, the train or validation data is used from the column called 'text' or the first column if no column called 'text' is found.
#     - The number of files under train and validation (if provided) should equal to one.
# - **Output**: A trained model that can be deployed for inference.
# 
# Below is an example of a TXT file for fine-tuning the Text Generation model. The TXT file is SEC filings of Amazon from year 2021 to 2022.
