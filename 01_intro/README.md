# Chapter 1. Generative AI Use Cases, Fundamentals, and Project Life Cycle

This chapter introduces various generative AI tasks and use cases, offering insights into foundational models and exploring a typical generative AI project life cycle. The use cases include intelligent search, automated customer-support chatbots, dialog summarization, NSFW content moderation, personalized product videos, and source code generation, among others.

You'll also learn about several generative AI services and hardware options from Amazon Web Services (AWS), such as Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, Amazon CodeWhisperer, AWS Trainium, and AWS Inferentia. These tools provide flexibility for building comprehensive, context-aware, multimodal reasoning applications with generative AI on AWS.

### Use Cases and Tasks

Generative AI, like deep learning, is a versatile technology applicable across various industries and customer segments. Here are some common generative tasks and their use cases:

- **Text Summarization**: Condense text while retaining key ideas, useful for summarizing articles, legal documents, or financial reports.
- **Rewriting**: Alter text to suit different audiences or tones, such as simplifying legal documents for non-legal readers.
- **Information Extraction**: Extract data like names or events from documents, e.g., converting emails into purchase orders.
- **Question Answering (QA) and Visual QA (VQA)**: Pose questions to documents, images, or videos, such as using a chatbot for HR queries.
- **Detecting Toxic Content**: Identify harmful content in text, images, or videos.
- **Classification and Content Moderation**: Categorize content, such as filtering spam or inappropriate images.
- **Conversational Interface**: Manage multiturn conversations, like chatbots for customer support.
- **Translation**: Translate languages, e.g., converting book content to German or Python code to Java.
- **Source Code Generation**: Generate code from natural language or sketches.
- **Reasoning**: Analyze problems to find new solutions or insights.
- **Masking PII**: Remove personally identifiable information from text.
- **Personalized Marketing and Ads**: Create tailored product descriptions or ads based on user profiles.

These tasks demonstrate the transformative potential of generative AI, powered by neural network architectures like transformers, which you'll explore further in Chapter 3.

### Foundation Models and Model Hubs

Foundation models are large neural networks with billions of parameters, trained on vast datasets. They can represent complex entities like language and images. Typically, you'll start with a foundation model from a hub like Hugging Face Model Hub or Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, which provide detailed model descriptions and use cases.

Throughout this book, we'll use Hugging Face Model Hub and SageMaker JumpStart to access models like Llama 2, Falcon, and FLAN-T5. You'll delve deeper into these topics in Chapter 3.

### Generative AI Project Life Cycle

While there's no fixed life cycle for generative AI projects, the framework in Figure 1-3 guides you through key stages:

1. **Identify Use Case**: Define your project's scope and start with a single, well-documented use case.
2. **Experiment and Select**: Choose a suitable foundation model, using techniques like prompt engineering and in-context learning (Chapter 2).
3. **Adapt, Align, and Augment**: Tailor models to your domain and align them with human values using techniques like RLHF (Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 11).
4. **Evaluate**: Establish metrics to measure model effectiveness (Chapter 5).
5. **Deploy and Integrate**: Optimize and deploy models for inference (Chapter 8).
6. **Monitor**: Set up monitoring systems for your applications (Chapters 8 and 12).

### Generative AI on AWS

AWS offers a comprehensive stack of services for generative AI, including:

- **Model Providers**: Access powerful compute and storage resources for model training and deployment.
- **Model Tuners**: Adapt models to specific domains using tools like Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker JumpStart.
- **End-to-End Applications**: Build custom applications using AWS's breadth of services.

AWS's benefits include flexibility, security, state-of-the-art capabilities, low operational overhead, and a history of innovation.

### Building Generative AI Applications on AWS

Generative AI applications require multiple components for reliability and scalability. AWS provides a range of services to build end-to-end applications, whether using packaged services like Amazon CodeWhisperer or custom solutions.

### Summary

This chapter covered generative AI use cases, fundamentals, and a project life cycle framework. You learned about AWS services supporting generative AI and the benefits of using AWS for these workloads. In Chapter 2, you'll explore prompt engineering techniques for both language-only and multimodal models.
