# Chapter 1: Generative AI Use Cases, Fundamentals, and Project Life Cycle

Chapter 1 provides an introduction to common generative AI use cases, key concepts, and the project life cycle. It highlights generative tasks such as text summarization, rewriting, information extraction, source code generation, toxic content detection, and personalized marketing. These tasks span multiple industries and are made possible by foundational transformer models.

The chapter also introduces AWS tools and hardware for building generative AI applications, including Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, CodeWhisperer, AWS Trainium, and Inferentia, emphasizing their flexibility and scalability for multimodal applications.

The generative AI project life cycle consists of several phases: defining use cases, experimenting with models, adapting and fine-tuning models, aligning them with human values, evaluating performance, and deploying them. Each phase involves iteration, model evaluation, and optimization. AWS infrastructure, such as SageMaker and Bedrock, supports these steps by offering pre-trained models and deployment options.

AWS services provide a foundation for custom generative AI applications, with the chapter discussing its breadth of features, including model hubs, vector stores for retrieval-augmented generation, and managed services for secure, scalable deployments.
