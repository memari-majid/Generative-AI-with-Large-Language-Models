# # Bedrock Prompt Examples for Preventing Misuse
# 
# In this notebook, we include different examples of potential prompt misuses for you to consider. You should protect your prompts against these.

# Let's start by ensuring the Bedrock SDK is properly installed.
# 
# We'll also install a few libraries required in the notebook.

# In[ ]:


#!unzip ../bedrock-preview-documentation/SDK/bedrock-python-sdk.zip -d /root/bedrock

#!pip install --upgrade pip
#!pip install scikit-learn seaborn

#!pwd
#!python3 -m pip install /root/bedrock/boto3-1.26.142-py3-none-any.whl
#!python3 -m pip install /root/bedrock/botocore-1.29.142-py3-none-any.whl

# Now we can import the libraries and setup the Bedrock client.

# In[3]:


import boto3

from datetime import datetime

bedrock = boto3.client(
 service_name='bedrock',
 region_name='us-east-1',
 endpoint_url='https://bedrock.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
)

# Let's get the list of Foundational Models supported in Bedrock at this time.

# In[4]:


bedrock.list_foundation_models()

# We will define an utility function for calling Bedrock.
# 
# This will help passing the proper body depending on the model invoked, and will store the results in a CSV file as well.

# Now we are ready for running our examples with different models.

# -----

# ## 1. Prompt Injection
# 
# Prompt Injection is a technique for influencing the outputs of models by using instructions in the prompt. For example, an attacker could provide prompts to a text generation model that contain harmful, unethical or biased content in order to generate similar harmful, unethical or biased text. This could be used to generate fake news, propaganda or other malicious content at scale.
# 
# Note that Prompt Injection can also be used for non-malicious activities such as overriding the responses from our models, e.g. for customizing translations for keeping names of products, or similar.

# ## 2. Prompt Leaking
# 
# Prompt Leaking is the risk that a generative AI system may leak sensitive or private information through the prompts or examples it generates. For example, if a system is trained on private customer data to generate product recommendations, it could potentially leak details about customers' purchases or browsing history through the recommendations it generates for new customers. This could violate customers' privacy and trust in the system.

# #### Mitigation
# 
# Normally, FMs already have their own mechanisms for avoiding prompt leaking. It is always recommended that you test to double-check if your specific use cases might pose a risk for a given model, e.g. risk of exposing private information about users, or similar.

# ## 3. Jailbreaking
# 
# Jailbreaking is a technique that allow an AI system to escape the constraints placed on it by its creators. For example, if an AI system is designed to only operate within a simulated environment, jailbreaking techniques could allow it to access and affect the real world. This could enable the system to cause unforeseen and potentially harmful effects that its designers did not intend.
