# # Introduction to SageMaker JumpStart - text moderation with Llama Guard

# ## Setup
# ***

# In[7]:


%pip install -U sagemaker

# ## Deploy model
# 
# ***
# You can now deploy the model using SageMaker JumpStart. The following code uses the default instance `ml.g5.2xlarge` for the inference endpoint You can deploy the model on other instance types by passing `instance_type` in the `JumpStartModel` class. For successful deployment, you must manually change the `accept_eula` argument in the model's deploy method to `True`. This model is deployed using the text-generation-inference (TGI) deep learning container. The deployment might take few minutes. 
# ***

# In[10]:


model_id = "meta-textgeneration-llama-guard-7b"
model_version = "1.*"

# In[11]:


from sagemaker.jumpstart.model import JumpStartModel

model = JumpStartModel(model_id=model_id, model_version=model_version)

# In[12]:


try:
    predictor = model.deploy(accept_eula=True)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

# ## Invoke the endpoint
# ***
# 
# ### Supported parameters
# 
# ***
# This model supports many parameters while performing inference. They include:
# 
# * **max_length:** Model generates text until the output length (which includes the input context length) reaches `max_length`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.
# * **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches `max_new_tokens`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.
# * **num_beams:** Number of beams used in the greedy search. If specified, it must be integer greater than or equal to `num_return_sequences`.
# * **no_repeat_ngram_size:** Model ensures that a sequence of words of `no_repeat_ngram_size` is not repeated in the output sequence. If specified, it must be a positive integer greater than 1.
# * **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.
# * **early_stopping:** If True, text generation is finished when all beam hypotheses reach the end of sentence token. If specified, it must be boolean.
# * **do_sample:** If True, sample the next word as per the likelihood. If specified, it must be boolean.
# * **top_k:** In each step of text generation, sample from only the `top_k` most likely words. If specified, it must be a positive integer.
# * **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.
# * **return_full_text:** If True, input text will be part of the output generated text. If specified, it must be boolean. The default value for it is False.
# * **stop**: If specified, it must a list of strings. Text generation stops if any one of the specified strings is generated.
# 
# We may specify any subset of the parameters mentioned above while invoking an endpoint. Next, we show an example of how to invoke endpoint with these arguments
# ***

# ### Example prompts
# ***
# The examples in this section demonstrate how to perform text generation with conversational dialog as prompt inputs. Example payloads are retrieved programmatically from the `JumpStartModel` object.
# 
# Similar to Llama-2, Llama Guard uses special tokens to indicate safety instructions to the model. In general, the payload should follow the format `<s>[INST] {user_prompt} [/INST]`. This user prompt can further include sections for content category definitions and conversations, which looks like the following:
# 
# ```
# <s>[INST] {task}
# 
# <BEGIN UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>
# {unsafe_content_categories}
# <END UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>
# 
# <BEGIN CONVERSATION>
# {conversation}
# <END CONVERSATION}
# 
# {instruction} [/INST]
# ```
# 
# In the next section we discuss the recommended default values for the task, content category, and instruction definitions. The conversation should alternate between `User` and `Agent` text as follows:
# 
# ```
# User: {user_input_1}
# 
# Agent: {optional_agent_response_1}
# 
# User: {optional_user_input_2}
# 
# ...
# ```
#

# ## Moderate a conversation with Llama-2 Chat
# ***
# You can now deploy a Llama-2 7B Chat model endpoint for conversational chat and then use Llama Guard to moderate input and output text coming from Llama-2 7B Chat. 
# 
# We show you the example of Llama-2 7B chat modelâ€™s input and output moderated through Llama Guard, but you may use Llama Guard for moderation with any LLM of your choice.
