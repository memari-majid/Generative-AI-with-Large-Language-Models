# ## Initializing the Hugging Face Pipeline

# The first thing we need to do is initialize a `text-generation` pipeline with Hugging Face transformers. The Pipeline requires three things that we must initialize first, those are:
# 
# * A LLM, in this case it will be `tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct`.
# 
# * The respective tokenizer for the model.
# 
# * A stopping criteria object.
# 
# We'll explain these as we get to them, let's begin with our model.
# 
# We initialize the model and move it to our CUDA-enabled GPU. Using Colab this can take 5-10 minutes to download and initialize the model.

# In[4]:


from torch import cuda, bfloat16
import transformers

model_name = 'tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct'

device = f'cuda:{cuda.current_device()}' if cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'

# set quantization configuration to load large model with less GPU memory
# this requires the `bitsandbytes` library
bnb_config = transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type='nf4',
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=bfloat16
)

model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
#    trust_remote_code=True,
#    quantization_config=bnb_config,
    device_map='auto'
)
model.eval()
print(f"Model loaded on {device}")

# The pipeline requires a tokenizer which handles the translation of human readable plaintext to LLM readable token IDs. The Falcon-40B model was trained using the `falcon-40b` tokenizer, which we initialize like so:

# In[5]:


tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Finally we need to define the _stopping criteria_ of the model. The stopping criteria allows us to specify *when* the model should stop generating text. If we don't provide a stopping criteria the model just goes on a bit of a tangent after answering the initial question.

# In[6]:


from transformers import StoppingCriteria, StoppingCriteriaList

# we create a list of stopping criteria
stop_token_ids = [
    tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(x) for x in [
        ['Human', ':'], ['AI', ':']
    ]
]

stop_token_ids

# We need to convert these into `LongTensor` objects:

# In[7]:


import torch

stop_token_ids = [torch.LongTensor(x).to(device) for x in stop_token_ids]
stop_token_ids

# We can do a quick spot check that no `<unk>` token IDs (`0`) appear in the `stop_token_ids` â€” there are none so we can move on to building the stopping criteria object that will check whether the stopping criteria has been satisfied â€” meaning whether any of these token ID combinations have been generated.

# In[8]:


from transformers import StoppingCriteria, StoppingCriteriaList

# define custom stopping criteria object
class StopOnTokens(StoppingCriteria):
    def __call__(self, input_ids: torch.LongTensor, scores: torch.FloatTensor, **kwargs) -> bool:
        for stop_ids in stop_token_ids:
            if torch.eq(input_ids[0][-len(stop_ids):], stop_ids).all():
                return True
        return False

stopping_criteria = StoppingCriteriaList([StopOnTokens()])

# Now we're ready to initialize the HF pipeline. There are a few additional parameters that we must define here. Comments explaining these have been included in the code.

# In[9]:


generate_text = transformers.pipeline(
    model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer,
    return_full_text=True,  # langchain expects the full text
    task='text-generation',
    # we pass model parameters here too
    stopping_criteria=stopping_criteria,  # without this model rambles during chat
    temperature=0.0,  # 'randomness' of outputs, 0.0 is the min and 1.0 the max
    max_new_tokens=512,  # mex number of tokens to generate in the output
    repetition_penalty=1.1  # without this output begins repeating
)

# Confirm this is working:

# In[10]:


res = generate_text("Explain to me the difference between nuclear fission and fusion.")
print(res[0]["generated_text"])

# Now to implement this in LangChain

# In[11]:


from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline

# template for an instruction with no input
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["instruction"],
    template="{instruction}"
)

llm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=generate_text)

llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# In[12]:


print(llm_chain.predict(
    instruction="Explain to me the difference between nuclear fission and fusion."
).lstrip())

# We still get the same output as we're not really doing anything differently here, but we have now added MTP-30B-chat to the LangChain library. Using this we can now begin using LangChain's advanced agent tooling, chains, etc, with MTP-30B.

# ## Falcon-40B Chatbot
# 
# Using the above and LangChain we can create a conversational agent very easily. We start by initializing the conversational memory required:

# In[13]:


from langchain.chains.conversation.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory

memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(
    memory_key="history",  # important to align with agent prompt (below)
    k=5,
    #return_messages=True  # for conversation agent
    return_only_outputs=True  # for conversation chain
)

# Now we initialize the conversational chain itself:

# In[14]:


from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

chat = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)

# In[15]:


res = chat.predict(input='hi how are you?')
res

# Looks good so far, but there's a clear issue here, our output includes the cut off we set of `"Human:"`. Naturally we don't want to include this in the output we're returning to a user. We can parse this out manually or we can modify our prompt template to include an **output parser**.
# 
# To do this we will first need to create our output parser, which we do like so:

# In[16]:


from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser

class OutputParser(BaseOutputParser):
    def parse(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Cleans output text"""
        text = text.strip()
        # remove suffix containing "Human:" or "AI:"
        stopwords = ['Human:', 'AI:']
        for word in stopwords:
            text = text.removesuffix(word)
        return text.strip()

    @property
    def _type(self) -> str:
        """Return output parser type for serialization"""
        return "output_parser"

parser = OutputParser()

# Now we initialize a new prompt template, for that we need to initialize the object with a conversational prompt template, we can re-use our existing one from the conversational chain.

# In[17]:


print(chat.prompt.template)

# In[18]:


prompt_template = \
"""The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["history", "input"],
    template=prompt_template,
    output_parser=parser
)

memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(
    memory_key="history",  # important to align with agent prompt (below)
    k=5,
    #return_messages=True  # for conversation agent
    return_only_outputs=True  # for conversation chain
)

chat = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True,
    prompt=prompt
)

# With everything initialized we can try `predict_and_parse` which will predict for our model and then parse that prediction through the output parser we have defined.

# In[19]:


res = chat.predict_and_parse(input='hi how are you?')
res

# Now things are working and we don't have the messy `"Human:"` string left at the end of our returned output. Naturally we can add more logic as needed to the output parser.
# 
# We can continue the conversation to see how well Falcon 40B performs...
